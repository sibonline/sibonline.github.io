<h2>Early Beginnings</h2>
<p>Founded in early 2024 by Mikaeel Muazzam, the SIB was built on the belief that students should have a platform to express ideas, organise impactful projects, and take their lead in shaping their academic experience.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>SIB Today</h2>
<p>Since our founding, the SIB has fostered several initiatives and hosted several events. From MUNs to Awareness sessions, we've done everything we can to make students' school journey more engaging and holistic. We've remained steadfast to our motto, "By The Students, For The Students."</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>Our Mission</h2>
<p>To create a culture of initiative, collaboration, and leadership by empowering students to bring their ideas to life and contribute meaningfully to the school community.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>Our Structure</h2>
<p>The SIB is currently run by a team of more than 10 members across different sections of Class 9, led from our organisational HQ in 9E. Each member takes on a specific role, ensuring every project is handled with care and precision. Additionally, our Ambassadors represent the Board in their respective sections, helping us stay connected with students across the grade.</p>
